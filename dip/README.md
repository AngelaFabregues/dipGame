======

dip is the DipGame Framework for Diplomacy Bot Development. [More info] (http://www.dipgame.org/browse/dip)

This framework is compatible with the communication protocol and message syntax of the Diplomacy AI Development Center (DAIDE). dip uses the Java AI Communication API (jac) to deal with the TCP/IP connection and provides a representation of the game state, the movements, and other interesting functionality that you will better discover by using it.

dip focuses on the board representation. Negotiation facilities are provided by nego. For an intuitive example of how to build your bot using dip take a look to the Quick Start Guide. Extra documentation can be found in [4].
