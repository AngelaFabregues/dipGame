dipGame
======

dipGame is a Multiagent Systems' testbed developed at the [IIIA-CSIC](http://www.iiia.csic.es) in Barcelona. The purpose of this testbed is to allow Artificial Intelligence researchers to test their research models by implementing them into a Diplomacy bot. In order to play diplomacy against bots or get more info about how to build a bot, check the [official site](http://dipgame.org) of dipGame.

## People involved

The dipGame testbed is part of the results of [Angela Fabregues](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~fabregues)' PhD developed at the [IIIA-CSIC](http://www.iiia.csic.es) under supervision of [Prof. Carles Sierra](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~sierra). However, other students have contributed to this project:
* Alejandro Serrano. Web based interface for humans to play that has been integrated into the [dipGame site](http://www.dipgame.org/browse/newGame).
* Santiago Biec. Initial prototype of GameManger.
* Helena Orihuela. Initial prototype of dialogueAssistant.

Being most of the source code of the components of this project uploaded to GitHub, other people will be able to contribute to this project. We thank them in advance. Take a look to [this link](https://github.com/AngelaFabregues/dipGame/graphs/contributors) to see them.
